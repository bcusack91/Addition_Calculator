**Name:** A Basic Addition Calculator

**Description:** This calculator includes options for students to input addition/subtraction tools.  Once students are in the system, they can check their work each step of the way.  If a student answers a question incorrectly, they are notified of their error.  This leads to immediate correction at each step of the process. 

**Installation:** n/a

**Usage:** A basic addition calculator that may be useful to elementary school students 

**Support:** E-mail me at brendan@cusackprep.com with questions

**Roadmap:** Plans to turn it into a more robust program with a refresh button, randomization of the number of digits that are added.  Need to fix a couple of bugs. 

**License information:** This is an MIT project.
